# BikeApp

This app is my first iOS developed using Swift.

I made it for APIDaysSF conference on 13-15th of June 2014 at Parisoma.

I gave a lighting talk about this project, you can find the slide [here](http://bit.ly/apitoolscar)

## What does it do ?
Find the nearest public bikes stations with bikes available. It's working in the Bay Area, and the data is coming from the BayArea Bike Share API available [here](http://bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json) 

I used [APItools](http://apitools.com) to reduce the payload and extract the data I needed
